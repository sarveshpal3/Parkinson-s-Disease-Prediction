# Parkinson's-Disease-Prediction
This project will detect whether a person has Parkinson's disease or not by using Machine Learning Algorithm.

The solution is to build an application that will detect changes in voice or
hand movements and catch Parkinsonâ€™s in time.
This model will be using SVM(support vector machine) algorithm.
In this project libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Scikit learn, etc. for
designing our model.
