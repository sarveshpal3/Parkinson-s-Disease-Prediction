# Parkinson's-Disease-Prediction
This project will detect whether a person has Parkinson's disease or not by using Machine Learning Algorithm.

> The solution is to build an application that will detect changes in voice or
  hand movements and catch Parkinsonâ€™s in time.
> And we propose to design a website for user interaction and can checkout his/her
  health status by himself regarding parkinson's disease
> We propose to design a model using SVM(support vector machines)
> We will use different libraries such as numpy,pandas,scikit learn,tensorflow etc for
  designing our model
> We will use Neural network concepts for obtaining better result of predictions in
  which we use processes such as data preprocessing where we will split the
  dataframes into training and testing data(more training data and less testing
  data).Once we get it we standarize the data from which we later predict about the
  presence of parkinsons disease with greater accuracy
